# ReadmeGenerator

## Description

This project was to create an application that takes user input from the command line and then generates a readme file with all the user input listed in different sections.

The generated readme file also needed to have a table of contents with working links, and a license badge at the top of the file based on which license the user chose when prompted with the command line.
